# Agent Template README

This template was generated by comparing Spark, Grove, and Launch Agent 4 agents to find common structure and content.

## Variables

Replace these placeholders when creating a new agent:

- **`NAME`** - The agent name (e.g., "Spark", "Grove", "New Agent Name")
- **`N`** - The agent's number in the sequence (e.g., "1" for Spark, "2" for Grove, "5" for Launch Agent 4)
  - Example: `A.6.1.1.N` becomes `A.6.1.1.6` for a new agent
  - All hierarchical doc numbers preserve their structure: `A.6.1.1.N.2.1` becomes `A.6.1.1.6.2.1`
- **`UUID`** - A unique UUID for each node (generate new UUIDs for each instance)
- **`UUID_REF`** - Reference to another document's UUID (update to point to correct documents)
- **`AGENT_SPECIFIC_CONTENT`** - Content that varies significantly between agents and should be written specifically for the new agent
- **`SECTION_NAME`** - Section names that vary between agents

## Structure

The template includes only sections that appear in all three reference agents (Spark, Grove, Launch Agent 4):

1. **Introduction** - Agent-specific content describing the agent's purpose
2. **Sky Primitives** - Implementation of Sky Primitives for the agent
3. **Omni Documents** - Agent-specific omni documentation

## Usage

1. Copy `agent-template.json` to a new file
2. Search and replace all variables with appropriate values
3. Review sections marked as `{{AGENT_SPECIFIC_CONTENT}}` and write custom content
4. Generate new UUIDs for all `{{UUID}}` placeholders
5. Update `{{UUID_REF}}` placeholders to reference correct Atlas documents
6. Validate the structure matches your needs
