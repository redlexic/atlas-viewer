Summary
Banxy outlined a proposal to transition the responsibility of artifact maintenance and updates to agents, including OEX, Prism, Pattern, and Rivers, before their token launch to manage the increased workload and establish clear tracking, though the overall process is expected to change with the Synome initiative. To address the difficulty of managing edits for many stars, Banxy suggested moving artifact edit proposals to dedicated agent forum categories, which requires a change in the voting process, offering the options of bundling proposals into a single poll or having multiple polls. Additionally, Banxy proposed giving the operational facilitator end-to-end access to manage GitHub PRs and discussed the need to draft the Ecosystem Accord between OBEX and Prism, which should be included in their respective artifacts, following the Genesis Capital Allocation.

Proposal for Operational Transition of Artifact Management Banxy outlined the need for a proposal to transition the responsibility of artifact maintenance and updates to agents before their token launch, moving into a transition mode between pre-token and post-token governance. The goal is to onboard resources like the present operational facilitator, reduce the workload on Atlas access and core facilitators, and establish clear tracking history for artifact edits per agent. Banxy noted that the current process would become unmanageable with four new agents (OEX, Prism, Pattern, and Rivers) plus the fixed rate star and Sky Base, resulting in up to eight stars running on the old model unless a change is implemented.
Anticipated Changes with Synome and Process Updates Banxy mentioned that the overall process is expected to change with the Synome initiative, which will rewrite the Atlas to be machine-readable and database-like, moving away from simple text. With Synome, the update process will change, likely moving away from forum posts or automatically generating them, and definitely eliminating GitHub PRs. However, this new process is still under development, and the current process will likely remain in place for the Genesis primes and a couple of halos, suggesting the current process improvements are still necessary in the near term.
Proposed Changes to the Artifact Edit Posting Process Banxy suggested changing the posting of artifact edit proposals, ideally moving towards the target model where agents post their own edits within their dedicated forum categories. The operational facilitator will provide training, help with templates, and perform the official review and approval or rejection on the forum to prevent unapproved posts from going to a vote, which mirrors the process currently running with Spark. This change will result in multiple Atlas edit proposals instead of a single one on the core forum, addressing the difficulty of managing edits for many stars.
Impact on Voting Portal and Proposal Bundling The move to multiple Atlas edit proposals creates an impact on the voting portal, which currently features only one poll for Atlas edits. Banxy discussed two options for managing the voting: bundling all proposals into a single poll, which would require core facilitators (Alier and Jensen Sky) to change templates to section off the various proposals similar to the executive vote; or having multiple polls. Banxy noted that having multiple polls might be perceived as spammy by voters, as they are accustomed to one Atlas edit proposal per week, and that the single-bundle approach also removes the flexibility for voters to approve one item but not another, which is generally not desired.
Suggestions for Handling GitHub PRs and Repository Structure Banxy suggested that the operational facilitator should be given end-to-end access to manage PRs to allow them to practice with smaller volumes and take ownership of the process. Another suggestion, based on circulating ideas, was to split the GitHub repository, either into an "Atlas agents" repository or one repository per agent, which would reinforce the split of responsibilities and mitigate the risk of one agent modifying artifacts for another.
Drafting the Ecosystem Accord for OBEX and Prism Banxy discussed the necessity of drafting the Ecosystem Accord between OBEX and Prism, specifying it as "incubation funding," which should be included in both OBEX and Prism's artifacts under the "Ecosystem Accords" section. The accord should specify key details, including parties, duration, and terms, but can defer full details to "future iterations of the atlas". Banxy also mentioned that the accord with OBEX will follow the Genesis Capital Allocation (the one between Sky and Prism), which will be the first accord for Prism and the second for Lounge Agent Six. Banxy offered to help with the final numbering once the latest Atlas edits are updated.
Next Steps and Timelines Banxy requested the operational facilitator to draft the proposal based on the discussed points. Banxy confirmed that the proposal would likely not be submitted until January due to holidays. Banxy also offered to share the draft of the Ozone artifact and is available for questions next week.

Suggested next steps
Banxy will move the ozone artifact into Soder Labs and share the link without giving any introduction.
The group will start taking this like fragmenting this already let's do this like for Obex.
