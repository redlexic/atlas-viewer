# Introduction

This is a proposal to shift responsibility for agent artifact edits from the Core and Atlas Axis facilitators to the OEA facilitators.

The intention is to go into a transition mode before pretoken and posttoken governance.

## Stakeholders

Core Council, Atlas Axis, Ozone, Endgame Edge

# Rationale

We want to get into the process as quickly as possible

We have additional facilitator resources now that Ozone has onboarded Redlexic to the Redline team, and they mature their operational capacity.

This shift will take some workload from Atlas Axis and potentially Core facilitators, freeing up their time and attention for other projects.

This adjusted process is more representative of the intended relationship between OEA and Agents. OEA can take ownership and responsibility around maintaining the agent artifacts.

Quality Control: OEA focus on agents means more attention, faster turnarounds. Additional OEA resources enables innovation on quality control processes for agent artifacts ensuring updates are accurate and timely.

Categorized Tracking History: Separating agent artifact edits from the larger Atlas edit proposal makes it easier to track the history of agent artifact edits. Currently discerning agent history would require extracting agent-related edits from numerous Atlas edit forum posts. This will create one source of truth for Atlas edits per agent, similar to the post-token launch processes.

Importance of Scaling: With genesis primes and halos coming, we will already be running this process. We have Keel, Gove, Obex, Prysm, Pattern, River, SkyBase and a fixed rate star coming. Grove will soon pass into post-token launch process. Continuing using the old model will mean an Atlas edit proposal filled with around 7 agent edits plus normal edits. This will become intractable quickly. Extracting these edits into separate threads will allow improve scalability.

Historical Records: We have the opportunity to build this out properly for new agents. We can’t easily create a record of edits from Day 0 for all of the current agents, but new ones will have a clear history of edits which is great for organizational clarity. Post token agents get their own category on the forums and then suddenly the history begins. This proposal would create a historical record from Day 1 of an agent’s lifespan.

Timing: We anticipate a big artifact edit for Prysm around February, so we have time to adjust this process to capture it in a way that brings all the above benefits.

Change Process

**Box 1: Post Artifact Edit**
Posting of artifact edit proposal on the forum in the Star Category: 2 levels, OEA facilitator can post on behalf of the agent in their dedicated category or we say we want to move it as close as possible to the **target model** and let the Agents post - we will train them, help them, provide templates etc. OEA facilitator will do official review - no risk that some random person does an Artifact edit, because there is a proposal step (this is the target process that is running with Spark).

**Poll Outcome**: Multiple Atlas Edit proposals rather than one. Currently there is one poll always for the Atlas edit proposal. There is currently multiple proposals for operational edits.

Suggestion is to bundle all edits it into one proposal - would require changing templates w/naming, multiple discussion threads, create additional sections within the poll - similar to Executive votes - similar to core spells and prime agent proxy spell sections.

**What do we do with the PRs?**

It might make sense to split the Agent Artifacts into their own repositories. Currently Endgame Edge could edit & merge changes to any of the agent artifacts. While we are currently operating in a high trust environment, the integrity of the Atlas should be protected through compartmentalized access practices.

Agents & Governance: Until they launch their token, they have no governance involvement. They can request changes to their artifact, but that’s it.

Everything else is done by the Core Sky team: Core council, core faciliators, Atlas Axis, Sky token holders. The agent and agent’s OEA is doing nothing until the token is launched - then everything is flipped to the agent and OEA facilitator. No transition period, transition period means that vote still happens on [vote.sky.money](http://vote.sky.money) but the handling of forum posts, approval, preparation of the edit proposal & hopefully the Github PR can be shifted to the OEA agent so the agent can manage their own governance until the actual token launch happens. This way the agent can manage their own governance until the token launch vote.

**Post Token Launch proposal**: Agents do their own proposals, have their Operational Facilitator manage the voting process, use Snapshot instead of the Sky voting portal, and the voting is done by the Agent token holders, instead of SKY token holders
